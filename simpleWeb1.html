      <h2>Canto 1</h2>

      <p style="color:red">"In the midway of this our mortal life,<br>
        I found me in a gloomy wood, astray<br>
        Gone from the path direct: and e'en to tell<br>
        It were no easy task, how savage wild<br>
        That forest, how robust and rough its growth,<br>
        Which to remember only, my dismay<br>
        Renews, in bitterness not far from death.<br>
        Yet to discourse of what there good befell,<br>
        All else will I relate discover'd there.<br>
        How first I enter'd it I scarce can say,<br>
        Such sleepy dullness in that instant weigh'd<br>
        My senses down, when the true path I left,<br>
        But when a mountain's foot I reach'd, where clos'd<br>
        The valley, that had pierc'd my heart with dread,<br>
        I look'd aloft, and saw his shoulders broad<br>
        Already vested with that planet's beam,<br>
        Who leads all wanderers safe through every way.<br>
        <br>
        Then was a little respite to the fear,<br>
        That in my heart's recesses deep had lain,<br>
        All of that night, so pitifully pass'd:<br>
        And as a man, with difficult short breath,<br>
        Forespent with toiling, 'scap'd from sea to shore,<br>
        Turns to the perilous wide waste, and stands<br>
        At gaze; e'en so my spirit, that yet fail'd<br>
        Struggling with terror, turn'd to view the straits,<br>
        That none hath pass'd and liv'd. My weary frame<br>
        After short pause recomforted, again<br>
        I journey'd on over that lonely steep,<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        The hinder foot still firmer. Scarce the ascent<br>
        Began, when, lo! a panther, nimble, light,<br>
        And cover'd with a speckled skin, appear'd,<br>
        Nor, when it saw me, vanish'd, rather strove<br>
        To check my onward going; that ofttimes<br>
        With purpose to retrace my steps I turn'd.<br>
        <br>
        The hour was morning's prime, and on his way<br>
        Aloft the sun ascended with those stars,<br>
        That with him rose, when Love divine first mov'd<br>
        Those its fair works: so that with joyous hope<br>
        All things conspir'd to fill me, the gay skin<br>
        Of that swift animal, the matin dawn<br>
        And the sweet season. Soon that joy was chas'd,<br>
        And by new dread succeeded, when in view<br>
        A lion came, 'gainst me, as it appear'd,<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        With his head held aloft and hunger-mad,<br>
        That e'en the air was fear-struck. A she-wolf<br>
        Was at his heels, who in her leanness seem'd<br>
        Full of all wants, and many a land hath made<br>
        Disconsolate ere now. She with such fear<br>
        O'erwhelmed me, at the sight of her appall'd,<br>
        That of the height all hope I lost. As one,<br>
        Who with his gain elated, sees the time<br>
        When all unwares is gone, he inwardly<br>
        Mourns with heart-griping anguish; such was I,<br>
        Haunted by that fell beast, never at peace,<br>
        Who coming o'er against me, by degrees<br>
        Impell'd me where the sun in silence rests.<br>
        <br>
        While to the lower space with backward step<br>
        I fell, my ken discern'd the form one of one,<br>
        Whose voice seem'd faint through long disuse of speech.<br>
        When him in that great desert I espied,<br>
        “Have mercy on me!” cried I out aloud,<br>
        “Spirit! or living man! what e'er thou be!”<br>
        <br>
        He answer'd: “Now not man, man once I was,<br>
        And born of Lombard parents, Mantuana both<br>
        By country, when the power of Julius yet<br>
        Was scarcely firm. At Rome my life was past<br>
        Beneath the mild Augustus, in the time<br>
        Of fabled deities and false. A bard<br>
        Was I, and made Anchises' upright son<br>
        The subject of my song, who came from Troy,<br>
        When the flames prey'd on Ilium's haughty towers.<br>
        But thou, say wherefore to such perils past<br>
        Return'st thou? wherefore not this pleasant mount<br>
        Ascendest, cause and source of all delight?”<br>
        “And art thou then that Virgil, that well-spring,<br>
        From which such copious floods of eloquence<br>
        Have issued?” I with front abash'd replied.<br>
        “Glory and light of all the tuneful train!<br>
        May it avail me that I long with zeal<br>
        Have sought thy volume, and with love immense<br>
        Have conn'd it o'er. My master thou and guide!<br>
        Thou he from whom alone I have deriv'd<br>
        That style, which for its beauty into fame<br>
        Exalts me. See the beast, from whom I fled.<br>
        O save me from her, thou illustrious sage!<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        “For every vein and pulse throughout my frame<br>
        She hath made tremble.” He, soon as he saw<br>
        That I was weeping, answer'd, “Thou must needs<br>
        Another way pursue, if thou wouldst 'scape<br>
        From out that savage wilderness. This beast,<br>
        At whom thou criest, her way will suffer none<br>
        To pass, and no less hindrance makes than death:<br>
        So bad and so accursed in her kind,<br>
        That never sated is her ravenous will,<br>
        Still after food more craving than before.<br>
        To many an animal in wedlock vile<br>
        She fastens, and shall yet to many more,<br>
        Until that greyhound come, who shall destroy<br>
        Her with sharp pain. He will not life support<br>
        By earth nor its base metals, but by love,<br>
        Wisdom, and virtue, and his land shall be<br>
        The land 'twixt either Feltro. In his might<br>
        Shall safety to Italia's plains arise,<br>
        For whose fair realm, Camilla, virgin pure,<br>
        Nisus, Euryalus, and Turnus fell.<br>
        He with incessant chase through every town<br>
        Shall worry, until he to hell at length<br>
        Restore her, thence by envy first let loose.<br>
        I for thy profit pond'ring now devise,<br>
        That thou mayst follow me, and I thy guide<br>
        Will lead thee hence through an eternal space,<br>
        Where thou shalt hear despairing shrieks, and see<br>
        Spirits of old tormented, who invoke<br>
        A second death; and those next view, who dwell<br>
        Content in fire, for that they hope to come,<br>
        Whene'er the time may be, among the blest,<br>
        Into whose regions if thou then desire<br>
        T' ascend, a spirit worthier than I<br>
        Must lead thee, in whose charge, when I depart,<br>
        Thou shalt be left: for that Almighty King,<br>
        Who reigns above, a rebel to his law,<br>
        Adjudges me, and therefore hath decreed,<br>
        That to his city none through me should come.<br>
        He in all parts hath sway; there rules, there holds<br>
        His citadel and throne. O happy those,<br>
        Whom there he chooses!” I to him in few:<br>
        “Bard! by that God, whom thou didst not adore,<br>
        I do beseech thee (that this ill and worse<br>
        I may escape) to lead me, where thou saidst,<br>
        That I Saint Peter's gate may view, and those<br>
        Who as thou tell'st, are in such dismal plight.”<br>
        <br>
        Onward he mov'd, I close his steps pursu'd.</p>
